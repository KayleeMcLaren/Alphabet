## What is this project?
This is a simple Java program which demonstrates the use of a For loop to print all 26 letters of the alphabet in order. First an Array called "alpha" is declared which accepts char values. Letters can be mapped to an integer values using the ascii table. The letter 'a' has the integer value of 97. A For loop is used to iterate 26 times and add the letters to "alpha" array, starting at with letter 'a' and then going through the rest of the alphabet.
